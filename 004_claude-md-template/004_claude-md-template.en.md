# CLAUDE.md Starter Template

A minimal, effective configuration file for Claude Code that you can customize for any project.

## What's Included

- **CLAUDE.md** - A starter template with sensible defaults for:
  - Code style preferences (ES modules, TypeScript, functional components)
  - Workflow rules (typecheck, lint, conventional commits)
  - Documentation guidelines
  - Agent parallelization tips

## Why Use This

Claude Code reads your `CLAUDE.md` file to understand your project's conventions. A well-structured config file means:

- Consistent code style across AI-assisted changes
- Fewer corrections needed
- Better context for Claude's suggestions

## Quick Start

1. Copy `CLAUDE.md` to your project root (or `~/.claude/` for global settings)
2. Customize the rules to match your preferences
3. Start using Claude Code - it will follow your guidelines automatically

## Customization Ideas

- Add your tech stack specifics
- Include naming conventions
- Define testing requirements
- Specify commit message formats
