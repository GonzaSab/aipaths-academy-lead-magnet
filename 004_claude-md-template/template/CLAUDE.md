# Project Instructions for Claude Code

## Code Style
- ES modules syntax (import/export)
- Always run prettier after changes
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Functional components only (no class components)
- Max 200 lines per file, 60 lines per function

## Workflow
- Always typecheck after code changes
- Lint before committing
- Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)

## Documentation
- Update README when adding new features
- Ask clarifying questions before major architectural changes
- Keep explanations concise (under 100 lines when possible)

## Agent Usage
- Use parallel agents for independent tasks to save time
- When planning, consider which tasks can run in parallel
