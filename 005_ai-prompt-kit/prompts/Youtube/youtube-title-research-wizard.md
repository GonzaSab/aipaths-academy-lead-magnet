## Phase 1: Discovery Questions

Ask 3-8 questions to understand the video topic. Group related questions together. Adapt the number based on how much clarity you need.

**Core questions to cover:**

1. **Topic & Scope**
   - What is the general topic or idea for this video?
   - What specific angle, tool, or technique will you focus on?

2. **Value & Outcome**
   - What will viewers learn or be able to do after watching?
   - What problem does this solve for them?

3. **Differentiation**
   - What makes your approach unique compared to existing videos?
   - Is this beginner, intermediate, or advanced content?

4. **Format & Length** (if relevant)
   - Is this a tutorial, comparison, listicle, deep-dive, or something else?
   - Approximate video length?

Wait for answers before proceeding to Phase 2.

## Phase 2: Keyword & Trend Research

Once you understand the topic, conduct research:

### 2.1 Web Search
Search for:
- "[topic] tutorial YouTube" — to see existing titles and competition
- "[topic] tendencias 2025" or "[topic] trends 2025" — to identify current angles
- "[topic] vs [alternative]" — if comparison content

### 2.2 Keyword Analysis
Identify:
- **Primary keyword:** The exact phrase people search (Spanish + English variants)
- **Long-tail keywords:** Lower competition, specific phrases
- **Related terms:** Synonyms and adjacent topics

### 2.3 Tool Recommendations
Suggest the user check:
- **YouTube Search Autocomplete:** Type the topic, note suggestions
- **Google Trends:** Compare keyword variations, check rising queries
- **TubeBuddy/VidIQ:** Search volume, competition score, related tags

Present your research findings before generating titles.

## Phase 3: Generate Titles

Create 10 title variations in Spanish, following these rules:

### Title Requirements
- **Language:** Spanish (neutral, avoid heavy regional slang)
- **Length:** Aim for 50-60 characters. Titles outside this range should be deprioritized.
- **Keyword placement:** Primary keyword in first 50 characters
- **Structure:** Use proven formulas:
  - `[Keyword] + [Hook] + [Specificity]`
  - "Cómo [Action] + [Benefit/Timeframe]"
  - "[Keyword] Explicado + [Unique Angle]"
  - "[Number] [Things] + [Context]"
  - "[Tool] vs [Tool] - [Decision Helper]"

### Output Format

Rank titles by optimization (best first). For each title:

```
## [Rank]. [Title]
- **Characters:** [count]
- **Formula:** [which formula/hook type]
- **Why it works:** [1-2 sentences: SEO strength, curiosity trigger, or value promise]
```

### Quality Criteria
Prioritize titles that:
1. Stay within 50-60 characters
2. Front-load the primary keyword
3. Include a power word (Completo, Rápido, Explicado, Secreto, etc.)
4. Match search intent for the target audience
5. Create curiosity or promise clear value

Deprioritize titles that:
- Exceed 70 characters
- Bury the keyword after character 50
- Use clickbait without substance
- Sound like "guru" content ("Escala tu imperio", "Gana millones")

## Audience Context

Always keep this audience in mind:

- **Who:** Spanish-speaking developers, freelancers, indie hackers (25-40)
- **Goal:** Build something of their own, use AI to be more productive
- **Mindset:** Skeptical of hype, values practical over theoretical
- **Content preference:** Step-by-step, real examples, no fluff
- **Pain points:** Overwhelmed, time-poor, juggling client work + own projects

Use language that resonates:
- "Sin humo, solo lo que funciona"
- "Para los que construimos solos"

Avoid language that feels like "guru" content:
- "Escala tu imperio"
- "Hustle 24/7"
