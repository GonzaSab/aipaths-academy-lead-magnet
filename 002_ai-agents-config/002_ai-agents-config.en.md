## What Are AI Agents?

AI agents in Claude Code are specialized assistants that automatically handle specific development tasks. Instead of manually prompting Claude for code reviews, commits, or database work, agents jump in proactively when they detect relevant tasks.

## What You're Getting

This pack includes 5 ready-to-use agents for common development workflows:

### 1. Git Commit Guardian
- Reviews your changes for security issues (API keys, secrets, etc.)
- Creates professional conventional commit messages
- Catches files that shouldn't be committed (screenshots, temp files)
- Handles the entire commit and push process safely

### 2. Supabase Database Manager
- Creates database migrations with proper schema
- Sets up Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Optimizes slow queries and indexes
- Manages database schema changes for your Next.js + Supabase apps

### 3. Next.js Security Auditor
- Scans your codebase for security vulnerabilities
- Checks for exposed secrets and API keys
- Validates authentication and authorization flows
- Reviews dependencies for known CVEs
- Ensures security headers are properly configured

### 4. Playwright Browser Tester
- Tests web pages in real browsers
- Checks for console errors and issues
- Captures screenshots and diagnostics
- Validates functionality before deployment

### 5. Codebase Cleanup Auditor
- Finds unused files and empty folders
- Identifies temporary artifacts and clutter
- Suggests cleanup opportunities
- Helps keep your repository organized

## Setup (Takes 2 Minutes)

1. **Download and Extract**
   ```bash
   unzip ai-agents-config.zip
   ```

2. **Copy Agent Files**
   ```bash
   cp agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/
   ```

   Or manually:
   - Go to the `agents` folder in the download
   - Copy all 5 `.md` files
   - Paste them into `~/.claude/agents/` on your machine

3. **That's It!**
   The agents are now active in Claude Code.

## How to Use Them

The agents activate automatically when relevant. Just work naturally with Claude Code:

**Git Commit Guardian:**
- Say "commit these changes" or "push the code"
- The agent reviews for security issues and handles the commit

**Supabase DB Manager:**
- Say "create a table for user preferences"
- The agent creates the migration with proper RLS policies

**Next.js Security Auditor:**
- Say "check my app for security issues"
- The agent performs a comprehensive security audit

**Playwright Browser Tester:**
- Say "test http://localhost:3000 for errors"
- The agent opens a browser and diagnoses issues

**Codebase Cleanup Auditor:**
- Say "check what we can clean up"
- The agent scans for unused files and suggests cleanup

## Tips

- Agents work proactively - they'll suggest themselves when relevant
- You can still use Claude normally - agents enhance, don't replace
- Check the individual `.md` files to see each agent's full capabilities
- Customize agent behavior by editing the `.md` files
